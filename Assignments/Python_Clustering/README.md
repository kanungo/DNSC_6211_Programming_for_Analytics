<h1>Clustering: K-Means</h1>

<b>Task:</b> Use data from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) dataset to create a cluster.

<b>Due date:</b> TBD

<b>Dataset:</b>
  - [Clustering Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) - [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data)

<b>Deliverables:</b>
  - `part1_new_feature.csv` file you create from clustering

  - File(s) of your code

<h3><b>Assignment:</b></h3>

<b>Part 1:</b> K-Means

1. Download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data)

2. Implement a k-means clustering algorithm from scratch (You may not use prewritten algorithms such as in sci-kit or other libraries). [Sample Tutorial - to get started](http://flothesof.github.io/k-means-numpy.html)

3. Submit .csv file named `part1_new_feature.csv` of the new feature for the test dataset made from your cluster - number it 1-X, 1 is the first cluster, 2 is your second cluster, etc. <i>(The hardest part about clustering is figuring out what the right number of clusters is. There are a few mathematical approaches to selecting the right number of clusters, but many times its just a business rule. Visualization of the clusters is important.)</i>
